Go to Releases to get scratchOS. Built with care and love by me :)

This scratchOS "distro" is themed after nature (plants & flowers). It has its own kernel (started from bottom-0, not forked on any other scratchOS builds.
I have developed an intrest for scratchOS back in 2024, but never made a full working version. Back in 24 July 2025, I got the interest back, wanting to complete the OS for its public release. After 5 months, on 3 January 2026, my first version (1.17) has finally been released.

Refer to me as Crayonity (she/her). I perfer a differnt pronoun and name here.


NOTE: ALL BETA BUILDS WILL BE MOVED TO A REPOSITORY SINCE I WILL BE RENAMINING THIS REPOSITORY!
